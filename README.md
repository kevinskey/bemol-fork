# ðŸŽµ Bemol Fork

This is a fork of [Bemol](https://github.com/ftchirou/Bemol), an open-source iOS ear-training app based on **Functional Ear Training**.  
It is licensed under the **GNU GPLv3**.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Tonal context ear training: Iâ€“IVâ€“Vâ€“I cadence, then single notes to identify by scale degree.
- Level system:
  - Start with 4 notes in C major.
  - Unlock new notes, accidentals, and keys as accuracy improves.
- Practice across all major and minor keys.
- Customizable with your own **SoundFont (.sf2)** for realistic piano playback.

---

## ðŸ“¥ Installation

### Option 1: Download via AltStore
1. Install [AltStore](https://altstore.io/) on your iOS device.
2. Add Bemolâ€™s AltStore source (see [upstream repo](https://github.com/ftchirou/Bemol)).
3. Install the app directly to your device.

### Option 2: Build from Source

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kevinskey/bemol-fork.git
   cd bemol-fork

**Bemol** is a **free** and **open-source** ear training app that helps music hobbyists and music students train and develop [relative pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_pitch), the ability to recognize a played musical note in a given [tonal context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_(music)).

# Background

**Bemol** helps people learn the character of each musical note by having them internalize how each note relates to its nearest [tonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_(music)) in a given [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)). In each practice session, the user is prompted to identify a series of played notes. Before each note, Bemol plays a [I - IV - V - I cadence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadence) to establish the key. After the user has identified the note, a short melody is played to resolve the note to the nearest tonic. Listening to this final resolution helps cement the relationship between the note and the tonic in the ear and the mind.

As this process repeats, the user starts to internalize the character of each note in a given tonal context. This helps develop [relative pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_pitch) and eventually they will have a much easier time recognizing any note as long as a tonal context is clearly established.

This ear training method was first described and implemented by [Alain Benbassat](https://www.miles.be) in his free [Functional Ear Trainer desktop app](https://www.miles.be/software/functional-ear-trainer-v2/). **Bemol** is simply a free and open-source implementation of the method for iOS.

# How it works

**Bemol** is organized in a series of progressive levels. The first level consists only of the **first 4 notes** in the key of **C major**. Once the user has at least 90% accuracy in this level, they can move to the next one, where they can practice the **next 4 notes**.

Once the entire scale is mastered, the next level will introduce **chromatic notes**. After this, a new key is introduced. This can go on until the user has practiced in all 12 major and 12 minor keys. Or they can choose just to practice in a random key after they have mastered the keys of C major and C minor.

# How to get it

1. **Bemol** is available on the [AltStore](https://altstore.io).
    - First, download and install the AltStore PAL app [here](https://altstore.io/#Downloads).
    - Then, copy [this URL](https://storage.googleapis.com/bemol/alt-store.json) and add it as a source in the AltStore app.
    - Finally, download **Bemol** from within the AltStore app.
2. Alternatively, you can install **Bemol** from TestFlight [here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/8vhsQVQQ). This option may be useful if you don't have access to the AltStore or if you prefer to use the cutting-edge version of the app.

<br/>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The version of the app in TestFlight is the most recent development version. Which means that it may contain newer features and/or improvements not yet available in the official release on the AltStore. On the other hand, it is also less stable and may contain newer bugs and crashes. You can help and contribute to the development of **Bemol** by reporting these bugs through TestFlight.

# For developers

## How to build and run

1. Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). **Bemol** is built with [Swift 6](https://www.swift.org) and [Xcode 16.2](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-16_2-release-notes).
2. Clone the repository and run `cd Bemol/`.
3. Run `touch ./Configurations/Signing.xcconfig` to create an empty signing config file.
4. Run `open Bemol.xcodeproj` to open it in Xcode.
5. Press `Run` in Xcode to launch the app in a simulator.
6. If running on a device, you have to provide the id of your development team in `./Configurations/Signing.xcconfig`. The contents of the file should look like this:
   
   ```
   // Signing.xcconfig

   CODE_SIGN_STYLE = Automatic
   DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = <your-development-team-id>
   ```

> [!TIP]
> To be able to hear piano sounds (and not sine waves), you'll need to download a [sound font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundFont) in the `sf2` format and save it under `Bemol/Resources/sound_font.sf2`. The TestFlight version of **Bemol** uses an excellent and open-source sound font from [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en) that you can download [here](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/soundfonts-and-sfz-files#list) (look for `MuseScore_General`).


## How to run the tests

- **Product** -> **Test** in Xcode.
- Or run `./Scripts/test.sh` from the command line. The tests results bundle will then be available at `Artifacts/test-results.xcresult`.

## How to ship

Run `./Scripts/upload_to_testflight.sh <marketing_version> <build_version>` to archive and upload a new build to App Store Connect. `./Scripts/next_marketing_version.sh` and `./Scripts/next_build_version.sh` can be used to automatically generate the required arguments.

The script expects the following environment variables to be set:

- `APPLE_ID`
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY`
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_ISSUER`

These are self-explanatory and their values can be found in App Store Connect. The script also expects a private key file to be available at `private_keys/AuthKey_<APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY>.p8`.
